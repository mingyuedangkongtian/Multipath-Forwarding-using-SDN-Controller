# Multipath SDN Demo

This code shows the benefits of multipath forwarding by displaying a JavaScript visualization of what is happening in the network while streaming a video between two nodes.

It uses WebSockets and animation.js for displaying the data, VLC and RTP to stream the video between the two nodes.
